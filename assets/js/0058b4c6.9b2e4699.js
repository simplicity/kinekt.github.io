Note that there are no mutable app or router objects that you have to awkwardly pass around. There\'s no controller classes to wrap around your endpoints. Instead, you typically have an endpoint factory from which you forge your endpoints, which ultimately are just async functions. The individual endpoints can then be imported into and served from a single file.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started":{"id":"getting-started","title":"Getting Started","description":"Kinekt is under active development.

When a request enters the server, it will be transformed into a context object and then passed through a chain of middlewares. This chain of middlewares is called a pipeline. Every endpoint you create is an individual pipeline.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
